                <h2>SUKANYA ROY</h2>
                <p>
                        Hello, I'm Sukanya Roy, a recent graduate of Jadavpur University with a Master's degree in Computer Applications (MCA). I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Honours) from the same university. I am a passionate web developer with a strong desire to learn and improve my skills.

During my studies, I developed a keen interest in web development and worked on several projects that allowed me to hone my skills. My knowledge of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, as well as frameworks like React, Node.js, and Bootstrap, has enabled me to create dynamic and responsive websites that meet the needs of clients and end-users.

One of my key strengths is my ability to work effectively in a team environment. I believe that collaboration and communication are essential in ensuring that projects are completed on time and to a high standard. I am comfortable working with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, and I am always willing to learn from my colleagues.

Apart from technical skills, I am also a good communicator and have excellent problem-solving abilities. I can effectively analyze and interpret complex information, identify issues, and propose solutions that meet the needs of stakeholders. My ability to think creatively and outside of the box has helped me to come up with innovative solutions to complex problems.

I am now seeking a web development role that will allow me to further develop my skills and contribute to the success of an organization. I am confident that my technical knowledge, strong work ethic, and passion for web development will make me an asset to any team.
